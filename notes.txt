Some notes related to the assignment

- For strategy 0, a lot of comments are added for explanation, it should not be that many comments in the code normally
- For strategy 0, it is using recursion so it could cause unforeseen problem when the size of output increased. 
- Test case is added for strategy 0
- Below are the command I used for installing some package to help to complete the task
// for env variable
npm i dotenv 
// for making API call to blockchain.info
npm i axios
npm i --save-dev @types/axios
// for validating BTC address
npm install bitcoinjs-lib

Thank you!!
